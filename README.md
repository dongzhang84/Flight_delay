This project is to predict flight delays depending on the flight itinerary, airports, time and so on. 

project_code1.py/Project_notebook1.ipynb gives outputs: delay_year.pdf and delay_month.pdf

project_code2.py/Project_notebook2.ipynb gives output: delay_year_min.pdf

project_code3.py/Project_notebook3.ipynb gives outputs: delay_year_companiese.pdf, which is the supplementary figure of delay_year.pdf.
